  <h2>Pros and Cons of Static Vs. Dynamic Sites</h2>

   <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>This report discusses the advantages and disadvantages of static sites versus dynamic sites. General information about static and dynamic sites is provided. Specific recommendations based on types of content and retrieval is discussed. The purpose of this report is to help users evaluate optimal methods of web development based on different types of content and retrieval systems in order to improve performance, search engine optimization and security. The most effective way to build websites is based on variables such as content, goals, values, resources and skillsets. </p>

    <p>To complete this report secondary research of technology publications was performed covering several subjects including advantages and disadvantages of static and dynamic sites, search engine optimization and security. Information is summarized in this report on these topics. Static sites are recommended for service oriented businesses (with no inventory), blogs, portfolios, informational content and other content that remains the same for every site visitor. Dynamic sites are recommended for retail oriented businesses with large product databases where search results change for every site visitor. However, content management systems used in dynamic sites are vulnerable to hacking through Java, JavaScript and SQL. Plugins, extensions and themes are also targets of malicious code injection. Good antivirus software can detect and remove malicious code. (A good firewall and VPN wouldn’t hurt.)</p>

    <p>HTML and CSS are open source and free to use, but require significant time and energy expenditures. Static sites can be published on both free and paid hosting domains depending on memory and functionality requirements. The alternative to HTML and CSS is the GUI environment. GUI environments assist users with no coding experience to create websites. GUI environments include Adobe Dreamweaver, Wix and WordPress. Wix and WordPress are also hosting domains with content management systems and templates that make building websites easy for amateurs. However, these types of sites are not appropriate for all situations and types of content. Therefore, cost/benefit analysis applies to each method of web development. </p>

  <h3>Static Sites Defined</h3>

    <p>A static site means that every page is already built and hosted on a web server as an individual file (Large, 2022). If a developer’s goal is to build a static site to host a blog, portfolio, service oriented business, or other unchangeable information, the developer should build a static site. Skillset requirements for building static sites are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are open source and free for everyone willing to learn. Static sites can be published on both free and paid hosting domains depending on memory and functionality requirements.</p>

  <h3>Pros and Cons of Static Sites</h3>

    <p>Static sites offer speed, security, affordability, and efficiency. Static sites are easier to host than dynamic sites. They load faster and rank higher in search engine results. This results in improved search engine optimization (SEO). Static sites are hosted on content delivery networks (CDNs) that distribute content globally. Users in any part of the world will have a fast loading experience when visiting a static site. With static sites HTML, CSS and JavaScript code are protected on the server end, usually a CDN which is more secure, whereas application servers used for dynamic sites are vulnerable to hacking and code injection. Static sites do not need a database to function. Pages are not assembled on the fly. Entry points exploited by hackers like JavaScript and MySQL requests are nonexistent. If anything does happen to a static site, files can be restored from the original HTML and CSS or easily migrated to a different hosting platform. However, building static sites with HTML5 and CSS requires significant time and energy investments when not utilizing a GUI environment. HTML5 is not a GUI environment. These are the major drawbacks of building static sites.</p>

  <h3>Dynamic Sites Defined</h3>

   <p>In contrast, dynamic sites are GUI environments that assemble page elements including content, themes, databases, and plugins on demand using a content management system (CMS). Assembling pages on demand can take several seconds and significantly affects SEO. Dynamic sites personalize content for every user meaning that content changes based on user searches and preferences (Large, 2022). Businesses with large inventories like Ebay.com or Amazon.com use a CMS.</p>

  <h3>Pros and Cons of Dynamic Sites</h3>

   <p>Dynamic sites use a CMS that is complex, slower, less secure and less affordable, but user-centric. Dynamic sites require a lot of maintenance. The more complex a dynamic site, the slower it renders, especially on mobile devices. With all those moving pieces, if one part of a dynamic site fails, the entire site fails. More complex sites are registered domains with paid hosting for increased security, memory and functionality.</p>

   <p>Dynamic sites have many moving parts and every moving part has a potential weakness that can be exploited by hackers. For example, in April 2022 over 6,000 websites hosted on WordPress were infected with malicious JavaScript code that was injected into more than two dozen themes and plugins including Google Code Inserter, social media widgets like Facebook, and metric reporting plugins (Cawley, 2022). Wordpress is a content management system that hosts over 455 million websites due to its large catalog of plugins that simplify website building for users who do not know how to code. Because of its popularity with customers it also attracts hackers. The plugins, themes, JavaScript, and SQL all provide entry points for cybercriminals. Botnet attacks are also very common on WordPress (Goodin, 2023).</p>

  <h3>Plugins and Extensions Defined</h3>

   <p>Plugins are code used to embed features like ecommerce payments and logins. Plugins are page specific. Extensions are code used to create additional features and functions for browsers like ad blockers. Extensions are browser specific. Those are the differences between plugins and extensions. While extensions are exclusive to browsers and not relevant to websites, web developers interface with the websites they are building through browsers. That is why this information is important to know. It is also why two antivirus software companies are referenced in the body of this report and in the "References" section. It is recommended that web developers obtain good antivirus software and firewalls to detect and remove malicious code. Malwarebytes.com and Pandasecurity.com both offer free and paid antivirus software. Users should perform research regarding antivirus software and utilize the best antivirus software for their situation.</p>

  <h3>Beware of Third-Party Plugins</h3>

   <p>All third-party plugins have the potential to compromise user security through malicious code or backdoors (pandasecurity.com). Plus, malicious code can be spread from user to user. Loss of control of user devices or websites is the first sign of infection. This can result in a data breech of user information (pandasecurity.com). For example, compromised company plugins like payment processors provide an avenue for massive data grabs to occur (Boyd, 2018). Plugins require Java to run and Java is the most vulnerable to hacking (Boyd, 2018).</p>

   <p>For this reason, Google, Microsoft and Firefox browsers do not allow third party browser plugins like Flash and JavaScript updates anymore because hackers were sending fake update files (Boyd, 2018). Hackers injected plugins on company sites with malicious code infecting browsers, files, and websites intending for that infection to be surreptitiously passed on to others (Boyd, 2018). These are called supply chain or pipeline attacks (Boyd, 2018). Static sites that do not utilize CMS or plugins are safest from these types of attacks (pandasecurity.com).</p>

  <h3>Beware of Third-Party Extensions</h3>

  <p>Third-party extensions are as vulnerable to malicious code as third-party plugins. In 2020, more than two dozen Chrome and Microsoft browser extensions were compromised by third-party extensions (Goodin, 2021). This resulted in 3 million users’ browsers being infected with malware (Goodin, 2021). These extensions stole personal data and hijacked browsers. This breech was not initially detected because it masqueraded as a Google analytics feature (Goodin, 2021). Google analytics software is free to use and provides invaluable information to web developers regarding website performance. Many websites use Google analytics.</p>

  <p>Third-party extensions can be updated with malicious code or contain dormant tracking code and malware to be activated later. Some of these extensions are purchased and some are free. If they are free to users it is because users’ data is the product (Knight, 2019). Besides tracking users and harvesting data, users never know when the ownership of these extensions and plugins has been transferred because there is no legal disclosure requirement. Sometimes developers are offered big money to sell their extensions to third parties. Once extensions change hands new permissions and disclosures are not required. New owners can update extensions with malware that spies on or inundates users with adware while capturing data and selling it (Amadeo, 2014). In fact, a few third-party extensions have been caught capturing credit card form data (Heddings, 2014). If an extension is constantly asking for permissions, block it or uninstall it because it is probably sending user data to a third party (Amadeo, 2014). The same goes for extensions that aggressively push bogus security warning pop-ups (Nield, 2019).</p>

 <h3>Conclusion</h3>

  <p>Static sites are recommended for service oriented businesses, blogs, portfolios, and informational content that stays the same for every website visitor. Static sites also improve SEO by loading faster and ranking higher in search engine results. Static sites are more secure because they do not integrate CMS vulnerabilities exploited by cybercriminals. Dynamic sites are recommended for sites with large product databases. Dynamic sites change content for every user by assembling pages on demand based on search parameters and preferences in order to personalize content. Dynamic sites are slower, which affects SEO. Dynamic sites provide avenues for hackers to exploit through Java, JavaScript and SQL. It is recommended that web developers use good antivirus software to detect malicious code and remove it.</p>
