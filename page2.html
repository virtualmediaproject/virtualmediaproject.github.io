  <h1>About</h1>

   <p>This is just for practice, not serious or final. This is the truth right now, but I can't tell the truth in the final.</p>

   <p>I was born in Southern California and lived near the ocean most of my life. In high school, I was on the swim team and only ever placed for freestyle and backstroke. I won first place quite a few times competing against other schools only for those two strokes. I never even placed for butterfly or breaststroke. After high school I went on to become a lifeguard where I learned a couple of other strokes. It wasn't until my early thirties that I learned to surf. Surfing is fun, but I got caught in an underwater riptide once and almost drowned. I know how professional swimmers and surfers drown in riptides now. I always questioned it before. Getting caught in a surface riptide is easy to get out of. Swim parallel to the shore, then diagonal. You'd better be in good shape because you'll be pushed out to sea the whole time. An underwater riptide is almost unsurvivable. I can tell you how to get out of it if you want to know.</p>

 <p>In my professional life, I've worked in the financial industry mostly. I worked for a couple of CPA firms, including one of the Big Four, creating financial statements and proposals. Thereafter, I worked in banking. I still work in banking. This is my side gig. </p>

 <p>I started off as an accounting major in California and obtained a bookkeeping certification, which is why those CPA firms hired me. I completed an A.S. in computer business technology. I'm an expert in computer applications and can create any kind of document. Creating proposals for CPA firms is where I got the idea to go back to school for a technical writing degree. Little did I know that wokeism took over every English Department in Utah. It must be worse in California. I left California when the state started floating the idea to pay employees in IOUs. That was a huge red flag, so I moved to a red state that is slowly being infiltrated and infested with leftists. These aren't even classic liberals. They're far leftists who believe in CRT, DEI and Marxism.</p>

 <p>I finished the requirements for the technical writing degree at USU, but I am embarrassed to put USU on my resume because of the severe leftist ideology being imposed on English students there. I'm afraid that potential employers will see the English degree in the Education section of my resume and automatically assume that I'm one of those leftist indoctrinated morons. That couldn't be further from the truth. I'm very conservative and cannot stand CRT, DEI, and leftist ideology because the arguments are illogical and severely flawed. They don't stand up to scrutiny. Anti-racism is the worst kind of racism. Plus, those idiot Humanities professors sell anti-racism while pitching Marxism like a bunch of hypocritical capitalists and then use anti-racism as an excuse to discriminate against and target anyone who doesn't think like they do. Those idiot hypocrites with zero integrity embarrass me and I don't want to be affiliated with them or their institution. But I have a lot of student loan debt, so I found a way to use this experience to my advantage.</p>

 <p>I am still operational. Play dumb, provoke, capture, publish. </p>
