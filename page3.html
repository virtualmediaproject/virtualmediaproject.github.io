   <h2>Four Common Hormonal Imbalances <br> and How to Restore Health</h2>

   <h3>Abstract </h3>

   <p>Prepared by: Justine Aragon</p>

    <p>This report examines the effect of diet on the endocrine system and how both diet and exercise can mitigate or eliminate disease. Methods include secondary research in peer reviewed medical journals, sports and physiology articles, and other publications covering several subjects including diet and nutrition, sports medicine, obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, endocrinology, intermittent fasting, and exercise. Hormones are responsible for body function and shape. Insulin, estrogen, testosterone, cortisol and thyroid hormones are discussed. Generally, where excessive fat accumulates in the body is indicative of a specific hormonal imbalance. Diet has everything to do with hormonal imbalances. Insulin resistance is the most prevalent hormonal imbalance in America even in people who are not overweight. It is recommended that people eliminate or restrict sugar and other simple carbohydrates from diets and eat more protein, unsaturated fats, and complex carbohydrates to improve health and to decrease and/or correct insulin resistance. Sugar and simple carbohydrates create insulin resistance over time while insulin resistance exacerbates other hormonal imbalances that increase chances for obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), heart disease, and cancer. In addition to diet, increasing physical activity to balance hormones is also recommended.</p>

     <p>Four hormones have the greatest effect on metabolism: insulin, cortisol, thyroid and sex hormones. If any of these hormones are dominant, weight gain and muscle loss can result. Insulin resistance is the most prevalent hormone imbalance in America. More than 50 percent of Americans suffer from insulin resistance and most don not know it. Insulin resistance is a reduction of glucose transport and absorption by cells resulting in a decrease in energy in cells, which triggers appetite to replenish energy in cells resulting in overeating and weight gain (Corveraa, S. Hardya, O.T., Czecha, M.P., 2012). Being overweight or obese means being at two times higher risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. Fat metabolism disorders are predominant in patients with Type 2 Diabetes leading to increased free fatty acids circulating in the blood, which increases insulin resistance and factors for cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, there is a correlation between visceral fat (fat in and around organs and muscles in the abdominal cavity) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Kawada, N., et al.). Visceral fat increases the odds of insulin resistance by 80 percent (Kawada, N., et al.). Visceral fat results in a condition known as lipotoxiticty because it releases inflammatory cytokines including leptin and adiponectin which impair insulin sensitivity. Therefore, visceral fat is associated with insulin resistance because it secretes these adipokines that impair insulin sensitivity in liver and muscle tissue (Kawada, N., et al.).</p>

    <p>While adipose tissue (fat) secretes toxins that exacerbate insulin resistance, liposuction and omentectomy (removal of fat cells) do not improve insulin resistance probably because people don not change their diets. Studies show that insulin resistance improves with a low carbohydrate rather than a low fat diet [Source]. Calorie restrictions do result in loss of visceral adipose tissue. When a calorie deficit is coupled with regular exercise the results are double; therefore exercise improves insulin resistance (Elsesser, J.,2021).</p>

    <p>There is a relationship between visceral obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes (Kawada, N., Fujii, H. 2020). Visceral obesity results in insulin resistance whereas subcutaneous fat does not. Unlike visceral fat, subcutaneous fat is not indicative of insulin resistance (Kawada, N., et al.). That may be due to different areas of fat storage secreting different hormones which could account for the different colors of fat in different areas of the body. Visceral fat is brown whereas subcutaneous fat is yellowish. Visceral obesity, NAFLD, and insulin resistance are directly related (Kawada, N., et al.). Visceral fat is the most dangerous type of fat and is associated with heart and liver diseases.</p>

   <h4>Insulin and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)</h4>

    <p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is attributed to obesity and eventually leads to chronic liver disease in the absence of dietary changes. NAFLD is prevalent in about 30 percent of adults and children in the United States (Alazawi, W., Wenhao, L. 2020). Of those suffering from Type 2 Diabetes, 60-80 percent develop NAFLD (Kawada, N., Fujii, H. (2020). People with Type 2 Diabetes have a five times higher risk for developing NAFLD. Of those suffering from NAFLD, up to one-third develop NASH, a much more aggressive form of liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer, and liver failure. These chronic liver diseases are attributed to high sugar and refined carbohydrate diets (Born, T.A., 2014). Whereas NAFLD is asymptomatic and can only be detected through ultrasound, NASH can only be detected by a liver biopsy. Risk factors for NASH include high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, and obesity (Kawada, N., et al.).</p>

    <p>Heavy consumption of soft drinks, high fructose corn syrup, and refined carbohydrates in highly processed foods has increased obesity worldwide, but particularly in the United States. Additionally, aspartame in diet soft drinks is a peptide ester that causes weight gain and increases risk for Type 2 Diabetes. One study conducted on adult men showed that high fructose soft drinks increase insulin resistance, stimulate NAFLD, and increase blood triglycerides. Consuming more than one high fructose soft drink per day greatly increases metabolic syndrome development. This risk does not occur in those who do not consume any high fructose soft drinks. High fructose comes from genetically modified (GMO) corn to increase sweetness (Kawada, N., et al.). (Note: GMO crops are glyphosate ready crops. Glyphosate is an herbicide/insecticide. Corn, wheat, and soy crops grown in in the United States are treated with glyphosate to dry them out quicker in order to get them to market faster. Glyphosate destroys soil bacteria, which is bad for the environment; and it destroys gut bacteria, which is bad for your immune system. Buy organic to avoid GMOs and glyphosate treated crops.)</p>

    <p>In addition to sugar and refined carbohydrate diets, a high saturated fatty acid (SFA) diet greater than 10 percent of total caloric intake stimulated insulin resistance, high low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels that contributed to NAFLD. Conversely, a diet between 7 and 10 percent SFA produced the opposite effects. But a diet lower than 7 percent SFA was as detrimental to the patient as a diet higher than 10 percent. Therefore, total daily SFA should be greater than 7 percent but less than 10 percent of total calories (Grzymisławski, M., Kargulewicz A., Stankowiak-Kulpa, H. 2014). Trans fats from hydrogenated vegetable oils produce inflammation in the body and disturbs lipid profiles no matter the amount ingested and should be avoided completely. Trans fats are genetically engineered (GMOs) fats created to increase shelf life of baked goods, margarine, and other food products (Grzymisławski, M, et al.).</p>

    <p>Monounsaturated fatty acids in the form of organic olive oil, soy, sunflower, nuts and avocado are Omega 3 fatty acids and very good for human lipid profiles. Ingestion of monounsaturated fatty acids induces healthy blood glucose levels and blood pressure and generates high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol while lowering LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Unrefined organic extra virgin olive oil (first cold press) in particular prevents metabolic syndrome responsible for insulin resistance and has many bioactive constituents and anti-oxidative properties (Grzymisławski, M, et al.).</p>

    <p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish, green leafy vegetables, and flaxseeds reduce visceral fat levels, decrease insulin resistance, and improve NAFLD. Fish oil high in EPA and DHA had the greatest positive effect on insulin resistance in human and animal studies (Grzymisławski, M, et al.). In fact, EPA and DHA deficiency can develop into NAFLD in both humans and animals. Omega 6 fatty acids found in eggs, animal fat, and cereals contributed to the development of NASH in patients, but when substituted for Omega 3 fatty acids, improved insulin sensitivity and LDL cholesterol substantially. Of these two types of fats, the healthiest ratio of Omega 3 to Omega 6 is 1:1 to 1:4. Monounsaturated fats are healthier for your liver, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels than polyunsaturated fats (Grzymisławski, M, et al.). </p>

    <p>High protein and low carb intake decreases NAFLD (Grzymisławski, M, et al.). Chronic protein deficiency and malnutrition lead to the development of NASH. High protein intake that displaces high carb intake decreases liver steatosis (fatty liver) involved in NASH and inhibits lipogenesis in the liver. High protein intake also decreases insulin output. Whereas a high fat diet like that in Keto is detrimental to patients suffering from NASH, a high protein diet is beneficial. However, Keto has been shown in studies to decrease NAFLD that has not progressed to NASH (Anekwe, C.V., Chandrasekaran, P., Stanford, F.C., 2020). In addition to decreasing liver steatosis involved in NASH, a diet consisting of 40 percent protein vs. a diet consisting of 15 percent protein reduces visceral fat and reduces cardiovascular disease. However, high protein intake is bad for the kidneys and prolonged ingestion can result in kidney failure. Moderate protein intake of 25 percent of total daily calories is best for overall health and still results in the same reduction of visceral fat as the high protein diet. The moderate protein diet is good for patients with NAFLD too as it results in visceral fat loss and increased insulin sensitivity. Plus, there were no side effects involved in studies with moderate protein intake (Grzymisławski, M, et al.).</p>

    <p>While some studies have shown that complex carbohydrates with high fiber intake of 40-50 percent of daily calories is beneficial for NAFLD patients (Grzymisławski, M, et al.), other studies show that the Keto diet greatly improves or reverses NAFLD. One study has shown that moderate coffee consumption (one to two cups daily) has antioxidant effects that suppress fat cell cytokine secretion (toxin), hyperglycaemia (abnormally high blood sugar), improves insulin sensitivity, and inhibits the development of NAFLD (Grzymisławski, M, et al.). Regardless of the method, lifestyle changes are vital for managing this disease. Since NAFLD is asymptomatic, many people go undiagnosed until it develops into late stage diseases like NASH with cirrhosis, cancer, and liver failure. People who are obese and who have Type 2 Diabetes should have a liver ultrasound performed to detect fatty liver disease and to see whether they have developed ascites (Veterans Health Administration, 2018). Ascites is a condition of cirrhosis of the liver where fluid fills the abdominal cavity between the abdominal wall and organs that looks like a pot belly. An ultrasound will confirm fluid in the abdomen. Treatment comes in the form of diuretics or a giant needle to extract the fluid. If fatty liver disease appears to be advanced, a liver biopsy for NASH and fibrosis should be performed to enable immediate corrective action. The minor form of liver disease, NAFLD, can be prevented or reversed with proper diet. To reverse NAFLD, it requires permanent changes in diet and takes between 9-12 months (Born, T.A., 2014.).</p>

    </ul>

   <h4>Cortisol Increases Visceral Fat and Results in Muscle Wasting</h4>

    <p>Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal cortex of the adrenal glands sitting atop the kidneys. Cortisol is an anti-inflammatory hormone released in response to stress and low blood glucose. Cortisol responds to low blood glucose by converting fat and protein (non-carbohydrate sources) into glucose through gluconeogenesis (the formation of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as protein) in the liver while decreasing glycogen synthesis. The breakdown of protein is known as proteolysis (Gandhi J., Thau L. Sharma S., 2021). The liver and muscles store glycogen supplies internally, but the release of cortisol into the bloodstream means that liver and muscle internal energy stores will not be utilized to supply energy. Instead cortisol will degrade protein to generate glucose (Gandhi J., et al.). In other words, cortisol will resort to breaking down muscle tissue to create glucose because the amino acids alanine and glutamine are easily converted into glucose. This results in muscle wasting and is a result of prolonged exposure to too much cortisol. Causes for high cortisol levels include low blood glucose, trauma, and high stress environments (including a demanding job and toxic relationships), prolonged high intensity exercise, high caffeine intake, viral infections, and ingestion of insecticides and pesticides in food. If cortisol release occurs over time, it can generate other hormonal imbalances that affect metabolism. For example, high cortisol levels also have a negative impact on thyroid hormones responsible for metabolism. High cortisol levels increase insulin resistance, which increases inflammation, which increases cortisol levels. Over the long term high cortisol levels damage hippocampal and cortical neurons so that these areas of the brain do not respond to hormones normally (Choi M.H., Kim E., Lee, D.Y., 2015). Ways to lower cortisol levels include getting more sleep, eating organic to remove toxins from foods, decreasing caffeine intake, eliminating stressors in the environment, and incorporating relaxation methods like traditional yoga or meditation. Cortisol dominant individuals should avoid strenuous exercise and severe restriction of calories as the stress on the body can increase cortisol levels. Plus, a low carb diet reduces insulin resistance and cortisol levels.</p>

   <h4>Symptoms of Cortisol Dominance</h4>

     <li>Apple body shape</li>
     <li>Osteoporosis</li>
     <li>Depression</li>
     <li>Frequent urination<li>

     <li>Irritability</li>
     <li>Round face</li>
     <li>Anxiety</li>
     <li>Increased thirst</li>
    </ul>
	
   <h4>Hypothyroidism Slows Metabolism</h4>

    <p>The thyroid regulates metabolism and has a lot to do with weight maintenance. Thyroid stimulating hormones (TSH) are, thyroxine3 (T3) and thyroxine4 (T4).  The thyroid gland produces T4 initially that must be converted into T3 to positively affect metabolism (Kapadia K.B., Bhatt, P.A., Shah, J.S. 2012). However, in the presence of insulin resistance and elevated cortisol levels, conversion of T4 conversion into T3 in the liver is inhibited and results in lower metabolism or hypothyroidism (insufficient production of thyroid hormones). One in five women and one in ten men are affected by hypothyroidism that is undiagnosed. Hypothyroidism occurs most frequently in people with coronary artery disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, NAFLD, and cancer. It also occurs in older people and women. As with cortisol dominance, strenuous exercise and severe calorie restriction will exacerbate a thyroid hormonal imbalance (Brenta G, Kapadia KB, et al.). Nutrient deficiencies, inflammation, gluten intolerance, environmental toxins like fluoride, chlorine, pesticides and heavy metals (mercury) interfere with thyroid function. Some nutritional factors are also associated with hypothyroidism including low iodine intake, vitamin D and selenium deficiency, and consuming alcohol (Bianco, A.C., Chaker, L., Jonklaas, J., Peeters, R.P. 2017). Omega 3 fats, selenium, vitamin D, zinc and iodine ensure healthy thyroid function. Avoid foods that contain goitrogens (substances that induce the formation of a goiter) that block proper thyroid function. These include soybeans, raw kale, and raw cruciferous vegetables and should be limited or cooked. Cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise has the greatest positive impact on thyroid hormones. However, high intensity anaerobic (weight lifting) exercise also improved thyroid hormones. Whichever exercise is utilized, higher intensity results in greater release of thyroid hormones, which improves metabolism for people suffering from hypothyroidism.</p>

   <h4>Symptoms of Hypothyroidism</h4>

    <ul class="disc">
     <li>Block body shape</li>
     <li>Feeling cold</li>
     <li>Joint pain</li>
     <li>Yo-yo weight</li>
     <li>Large all over</li>
     <li>Change in voice</li>
     <li>Hair loss</li>
     <li>Fluid retention<li>
     <li>Fatigue<li>
     <li>Muscle weakness</li>
     <li>Memory problems</li>
     <li>Itchy dry skin</li>
    </ul>
  
   <h4>Estrogen Can Induce Weight Gain</h4>

    <p>Estrogen has many health benefits. It increases HDL cholesterol, decreases LDL cholesterol, and dilates blood vessels to increase blood flow. Estrogen also eliminates free radicals to prevent damage to the circulatory system. However, too much estrogen in women results in weight gain in the lower body around the abdomen, hips, and thighs (Hyman, M. 2020). Fat cells in turn secrete more estrogen. The more fat cells a woman has the more estrogen is circulating in her system. Another drawback of too much estrogen is that it impedes muscle gain. However, cardio and resistance training decrease estrogen in women. Estrogen dominant women should not use hormonal birth control but should eat a lot of cruciferous vegetables and high quality fiber to eliminate excess estrogen (Hyman, M.).</p>

    <p>Too much estrogen in men can indicate low testosterone levels and result. Taking statin drugs that block cholesterol production reduces testosterone because cholesterol produces testosterone. Therefore, do not eat a low fat diet, just change the types of fats to increase HDL cholesterol and decrease LDL cholesterol. Eat a low sugar, low carb diet with plenty of good fats, fiber, and protein. Do not consume alcohol because alcohol is converted into sugar in the liver and contributes to fatty liver disease, high triglycerides, and hormonal imbalances. Engage in regular exercise, both aerobic and anaerobic, because it balances hormones, reduces fat, and increases muscle. </p>

   <h4>Symptoms of Estrogen Dominance</h4>

  <ul class="disc">
   <li>Pear body shape</li>
   <li>Weight gain</li>
   <li>Memory problems</li>
   <li>Gynocomastia</li>
   <li>Fertility issues</li>
   <li>Hair loss</li>
   <li>Fatigue</li>
   <li>Osteoporosis</li>
   <li>Sexual dysfunction</li>
   <li>Irritability</li>
   <li>Insomnia</li>
  </ul>
	
   <h4>Soy’s Effects on Hormones and Muscle Gain</h4>

    <p>The soy industry will downplay soy’s side effects and emphasize that soy’s isoflavones and phytonutrients protect against prostate and breast cancers and other diseases. If soy did not have such high estrogenic effects on the human body it would not be such a successful estrogen hormone therapy in menopausal women. In fact, soy is a safe alternative to hormone replacement without the dangerous side effects (breast cancer). The phytoestrogens (plant estrogens) can protect against cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and LDL cholesterol. The downside is that in estrogen dominant women soy will impede fat loss and muscle gain.</p> 

    <p>Of greater importance is the fact that some males who were given soy formulas as babies have had their reproductive development disrupted by estrogens. One study showed that isoflavones in soy disrupted sexual development in animals when fed soy infant formula (Desmawati, D., Sulastri, D. 2019). This disruption is manifest as gynocomastia (man boobs), lowered sperm count, undersized genitals, and other reproductive development issues. The highest risk of feminization in males is in the womb, during infancy, and during puberty (Desmawati, D., Sulastri, D.). While some studies claim that soy consumption does not demasculinize males, heavy soy consumption does cause gynecomastia in males due to high phytoestrogen content in soy. Also, phytoestrogen can lead to increased body fat in athletes. And soy has been associated with thyroid problems. Read food labels because almost 75 percent of processed food in America has soy protein in it.</p>

    <p>While soy is a complete protein, its BV is 74. High BV foods reduce muscle wasting during resting periods more than low BV foods meaning that they are anti-catabolic. The most biologically available proteins with high BV are whey (104 BV) and whole eggs (100 BV). Bodybuilders rely on these proteins to pack on muscle more than other types of protein especially when dieting because the lower the caloric intake, the greater the quality of protein needed to build and maintain muscle. Besides the low BV content of soy, many bodybuilders avoid soy due to its low leucine and methionine contents, which are important for protein synthesis and muscle growth. Methionine in particular contributes to the production of glutathione (GSH), which is responsible for LDL cholesterol from oxidizing and clogging arteries. Leucine is the most important essential amino acid for building and maintaining muscle. Leucine is found in abundance in whey protein and meat, but not in soy. Whey protein has between 11 and 13 grams of leucine per serving whereas soy has about 8 to 9 grams per serving. Plus, whey protein is quickly digested and enables protein synthesis immediately upon ingestion due to its high leucine content. Soy protein is an okay protein source for athletes as long as it is not their only protein source. However, soy is cheaper than meat and has protective qualities in the isoflavones. For example, soy can enhance muscle recovery because it contains protective antioxidants that reduce free radicals accrued during exercise. Soy also absorbs more slowly than whey, which can provide a more prolonged release of amino acids to build muscle after workouts. Athletes who consume both whey and soy may reap the benefits of both (e.g., one scoop of each in a protein drink) (Robson, D. 2019).</p>

   <h3>The Ketogenic (Keto) Diet Can Reverse Insulin Resistance and NAFLD</h3>

    <p>The ketogenic diet was originally developed to control seizures in epileptic patients in the 1920s and 1930s. It is believed that the ketones produced by the ketogenic diet do not cause convulsions when crossing the blood-brain barrier (Dashti, H.M., Hussein, T., Mathew, T.C., et al. 2004). The ketogenic diet transitioned from controlling seizures in epileptic patients to a weight loss diet due to its low carbohydrate intake. In the ketogenic diet, ketones are released from the breakdown of body fat which is used as fuel instead of glucose. This ketotic state alters metabolism and stabilizes neurons involved in epilepsy (Dashti, H.M., et al.). The ketogenic diet is high in fat, low in carbs, and moderate in protein. Carb intake is between 20 to 50 grams per day from non-starchy vegetables like kale, broccoli, green salads, etc. Protein is high enough to maintain muscle, but low enough to maintain ketosis because the amino acids alanine and glutamine can be converted into glucose and end ketosis. The brain cannot use fatty acids as fuel but ketones can cross the blood-brain barrier and provide fuel for the brain which is usually dependent on glucose. The ketogenic diet has been observed inducing gene expression in the brain which might account for the suppression of seizures in epileptic patients (Dashti, H.M., et al.).</p>

    <p>Because fat is higher in calories than carbohydrates, most people believe that a high fat diet leads to obesity and heart disease. This study showed that a ketogenic diet reduced fat stores and the risk of heart disease in obese patients (Dashti, H.M., et al.). It may seem illogical that eating such high amounts of fat like that in the Keto diet can result in fat loss in obese patients. However, since incomplete oxidation of fatty acids in the liver results in the accumulation of ketones in the body, ketosis occurs that alters the body’s fuel source from carbohydrates to fat. Therefore, fat metabolism increases thereby decreasing fat stores in the body including visceral fat (Jabriya, Kuwait).</p>

    <p>The ketogenic diet contains 75% to 90% calories from fat, 10% from protein, and 5% from carbs (Dashti, H.M., et al.). However, protein intake should be increased for individuals performing weightlifting to build and maintain muscle. Also, some people choose to increase carbs to 25-50 grams per day to increase fiber and phytonutrient intakes (to maintain healthy gut bacteria). The reduction of glucose and insulin due to the ketogenic diet leads to improved insulin sensitivity. The ketogenic diet induces ketosis which manifests as the physiological state of fasting and causes the body to use fat (ketones) instead of glucose or glycogen as fuel sources. Keto is effective for weight loss and blood glucose control. The Keto diet produced long-term effects on glucose regulation that medications do not. For example, in one study, "heart and vascular complications reduced by 14% and 37%, respectively" (Dashti, H.M., et al.). This meta-analysis concentrated on weight reduction in obese diabetic patients utilizing the ketogenic diet. It resulted in fat loss, especially visceral fat, reduced blood pressure, and improved insulin resistance and fat metabolism, which also decreased fatty liver. This meta-analysis involved 13 studies on the ketogenic diet and its effects. All were effective at reducing body weight, controlling blood glucose and insulin levels, and improved fat metabolism (Dashti, et al.). Those who practice the ketogenic diet lose more weight and keep it off compared to those on low fat diets. They also experience less hunger and have higher metabolisms than low fat dieters.</p>

    <p>While a complete transition from glucose to ketones as a fuel source takes about a week, after a few days of following the ketogenic diet, the body changes its energy metabolism and begins to use fat instead of glucose as an energy source thereby reducing insulin production. However, there are side effects when beginning the ketogenic diet that include fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting known as the "keto flu." All these side effects were mild and subsided in time (after two weeks). Hunger was also experienced in the beginning, but dissipated significantly over time. Other negative side effects of the ketogenic diet included elevated LDL blood cholesterol and liver enzymes, especially in those with NASH. Patients with NASH should not participate in the Keto diet.</p>

   <h4>Effects of Exercise on Hormonal Imbalances</h4>

    <p>High intensity interval training (HIIT) may be more effective at reducing subcutaneous and abdominal fat than any other exercise (Boutcher, S.H. 2010). It also significantly lowers insulin resistance and increases fat oxidation and glucose uptake. However, cortisol does increase during HIIT sessions, so if someone is cortisol dominant, do not begin an exercise regimen with HIIT. Cortisol dominant people should begin with low intensity exercise like walking, Pilates, weight machines, swimming, etc. Once stress levels decrease, cortisol dominant people can incorporate HIIT once or twice a week followed by more low intensity exercise to ease into it. HIIT has resulted in improved insulin uptake of between 23 percent and 58 percent (Boutcher, S.H. 2010).</p>
